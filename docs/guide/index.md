# PaperWeight User Guide

Welcome to PaperWeight! This guide will help you understand how to use the app effectively and make the most of its unique analog-to-digital workflow.

## What is PaperWeight?

PaperWeight is a fitness tracking application designed for people who love the focus and tactile experience of handwritten workout logs but also want the analytical power of digital tracking. 

Instead of forcing you to input data during your workout (which can be distracting), PaperWeight lets you:

1. **Write your workout on paper** - Stay focused, no screen distractions
2. **Take a photo** when you're done
3. **Let AI convert** your handwriting to digital data
4. **Analyze your progress** with powerful charts and insights

## Core Philosophy

### Analog During, Digital After

The key insight behind PaperWeight is timing. During your workout, you want to be present and focused. Screens, notifications, and complex interfaces are distractions. But after your workout, you want rich data analysis and progress tracking.

PaperWeight respects this natural workflow by keeping the workout experience purely analog while providing sophisticated digital analysis afterward.

### Your Data, Your Way

We believe your workout data should belong to you and integrate with your existing fitness ecosystem. That's why we provide:

- **Strava integration** for comprehensive fitness tracking
- **Export capabilities** for your data
- **Open APIs** for custom integrations

## Who Should Use PaperWeight?

PaperWeight is perfect for:

- **Strength training enthusiasts** who want detailed exercise tracking
- **Athletes** who prefer handwritten logs but want digital insights
- **Data-driven trainers** who want to analyze long-term trends
- **Anyone** who finds smartphone apps distracting during workouts. PaperWeight allows you to leave the phone out of the gym entirely.

## What Makes PaperWeight Different?

- **No mid-workout data entry** - Write naturally on paper
- **AI-powered recognition** - No manual transcription needed
- **Flexible format support** - Works with your existing log format
